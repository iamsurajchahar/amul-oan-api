"""Import voice and chat turns into the telemetry database (telemetry/clickhouse/).

Rows never carry a phone number or anyone's words: user ids are only kept as
an HMAC under a secret caller key, and question/answer keep only their length
and sha256.

No trace is dropped without a record: every root trace of a day gets one row in
telemetry.trace_ledger saying what became of it (a turn, rejected with the
reason, a known non-turn activity, or unrecognised).
